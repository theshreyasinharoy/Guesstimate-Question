# •	Estimate the number of ice cream cups sold annually in India.

Population of India = 1.5 billion = 1,500,000,000

### For an average Indian consumer: -

1 cup/month for 9 months = 9 cups

3 cups/month for 3 months (Summer season – March, April, May) = 9 months

Total 18 cups/year

Total cups/year for all Indians = 18 x 1,500,000,000 = 270,00,000,000

### Wedding Season: -

No. of weddings/year = 10,00000

No. of ice cream cups/wedding = 800

Total cups/year = 800 x 1000000 = 800,000,000

### Birthday Parties: -

No. of parties/year = 50,000

No. of cups/party = 80

Total cups/year = 80 x 50000 = 40,00,000

### Miscellaneous Celebrations: -
### (Small House Parties, Graduation Day, Corporate events, special days in school/college hostel)

No. of celebrations/year = 50,000

No. of cups/celebration = 100

Total cups/year = 50,000 x 100 = 5,000,000


Total ice cream cups sold in India in a year = 270,00,000,000 + 800,000,000 + 40,00,000 + 5,000,000 = 27,80,90,00,000 (Around 27 billion)
